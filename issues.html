    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Our Issues</h2>
        <p>
            At UPCE, we address issues that shape our world and daily lives. From the ambitious to the absurd, our commitment is unwavering. 
            Whether it’s global influence, local communities, or bagel supply chains, we stand ready to engage, adapt, and lead.
        </p>

    <!-- World Domination -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>1. World Domination (Strategic Global Influence)</h2>
        <p>
            Our most ambitious goal is to achieve a thoughtful and considerate form of world domination. 
            We believe in leading with strategy and adaptability, ensuring that our global influence is felt in every decision, law, and bagel shop worldwide. 
            Through advocacy and policy influence, we aim to create a unified world under our visionary guidance.
        </p>

    <!-- Bagel Production and Accessibility -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>2. Bagel Production and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            The bagel industry is at a crossroads. Rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and underrepresentation of niche flavors threaten our access to quality bagels.  
            We demand **bagel equity** for all and advocate for policies that support sustainable bagel production, fair pricing, and free cream cheese for every citizen.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Education Reform -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>3. Education Reform</h2>
        <p>
            Education is the backbone of a thriving society. We support reforming outdated schooling systems by pushing for more inclusive curriculums, improved mental health support, and the integration of real-world skills—like how to navigate confusing ballot measures or manage a global bagel empire.  
            We believe in empowering students to lead, innovate, and think critically.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Environmental Sustainability -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>4. Environmental Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
            The health of our planet is non-negotiable. We advocate for stronger environmental protections, renewable energy initiatives, and sustainable agriculture—especially in industries critical to our cause, like wheat farming for bagel production.  
            Protecting the environment is essential to securing a future where both humanity and bagels can thrive.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Technology and AI Ethics -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>5. Technology and AI Ethics</h2>
        <p>
            Technology is evolving faster than our understanding of its impact. We call for responsible innovation and regulation in artificial intelligence, data privacy, and automation.  
            Our goal is to ensure that emerging technologies serve the public good—and maybe even help automate bagel delivery.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Healthcare Access and Innovation -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>6. Healthcare Access and Innovation</h2>
        <p>
            Access to affordable and quality healthcare should be a fundamental right. We champion healthcare reforms that focus on accessibility, mental health services, and medical innovation.  
            We also support research into the health benefits of bagel consumption (in moderation).
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Space Exploration and Expansion -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>7. Space Exploration and Expansion</h2>
        <p>
            Why stop at Earth? UPCE believes in advancing humanity’s presence beyond our planet.  
            We advocate for policies that encourage sustainable space exploration and support future efforts to establish interplanetary bagel franchises.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Social Justice and Equality -->
    <section class="issue">
        <h2>8. Social Justice and Equality</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to fostering a just and equitable society. UPCE stands for human rights, racial and gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and inclusive policies.  
            Everyone deserves a seat at the table—and a bagel on their plate.
        </p>
